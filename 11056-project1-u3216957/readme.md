    Canberra Modern Website


README

    A website designed for 'Canberra Modern' that uses a simplistic style with changes to the previous
    website with a minimised navbar. To have a simple and easier guidance when operating the website.
    It has only pages for the home, about, events and one called Canberras Modern. The home page is
    to outline everything within the whole website but not in detail. The about page explains about 
    Canberra modern, their end goal and the people involved. The events page is another page taken from
    the current website which allows viewers to book upcoming events and see previous events that viewers
    wish to attend. The "Canberras Modern" page is another exert from the current website but has been
    changed in order to create a better appearance.

VISUALISATION

    Before undergoing coding the website, previous drawing mockups were made to give an easier picture 
    of the end product and how to navigate around certain paths to achieve a look.
