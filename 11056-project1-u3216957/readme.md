    CANBERRA MODERN WEBSITE
    
Project status:Prototyping stage

README

    A website designed for 'Canberra Modern' that uses a simplistic style with changes to the previous
    website with a minimised navbar. To have a simple and easier guidance when operating the website.
    It has only pages for the home, about, events and one called Canberras Modern. The home page is
    to outline everything within the whole website but not in detail. The about page explains about 
    Canberra modern, their end goal and the people involved. The events page is another page taken from
    the current website which allows viewers to book upcoming events and see previous events that viewers
    wish to attend. The "Canberras Modern" page is another exert from the current website but has been
    changed in order to create a better appearance.

VISUALISATION

    Before undergoing coding the website, previous drawing mockups were made to give an easier picture 
    of the end product and how to navigate around certain paths to achieve a look.

EVENTS

    First example utilised was a bit of a confusing setup as opposed to the current website.
    Second example outlines a simpler method in relation to the current website but very similar.

ROADMAP

    In building the website it first started off with creating a simple layout of each page and from that
    it began by working at the navbar and footer to be cohesive for each page but not yet responsive. From
    that, content was made up for each page and it was then made to be organised in CSS.
    
    The organisation on CSS was frustrating and quite difficult for the end result of the website and had
    at times made the HTML file need to be reconfigured to fit for what was needed to be done. It was also
    known at times to be missing an ending "}" and made the whole process a big reading map.
    
    After the content was configured and organised in CSS, when realised on tablet, it seemed to conform 
    well from the desktop form. However, for mobile platforms, it seemed to be difficult and was where 
    most of the reconfiguring began for making the website responsive. How this was navigated was to
    remove images from pages with words as they were an actual pain. It was also attempted to have a 
    hover feature for each individual image for the "Canberras modern" page to outline each architectural
    building's name and seemed to have a lot go wrong in the process so I had revoked doing this.

PROBLEMS
