            <h3>What's so special about Canberra?</h3>
            <p>Canberra is a young city with a rich architectural legacy. With major boom periods in the 1920s and again from the 1950s-1980s - the architectural aesthetic of the city is eclectic, but deliberately cohesive.</p>

            <p>The mid-late twentieth century period of development in Canberra, specifically during the National Capital Development Commission’s (NCDC) oversight (1958-1989) has not been widely celebrated or recognised by the Canberra community.</p>
            
            <p>Major developments not only in residential, but civic and community buildings saw the frequent involvement of architects now considered pioneers of the modernist movement, and the construction of a key collection of iconic and unique mid-century buildings in Australia.</p>
            
            <p>Many of these structures, which make an irreplaceable contribution to Canberra, have already been lost and many face risk of being lost in the near future.</p>  
                
            <p>So we at Canberra Modern are here to help by engaging Canberra and Australia with their contemporary National Capital.</p>
